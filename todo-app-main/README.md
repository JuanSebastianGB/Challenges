## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Drag and Dropt Functionality.
- Deeper understanding of useRef Hook
- Deeper understanding of useCallBack Hook
- Deeper understanding of useCallBackMemo Hook

### Continued development

- This project was implemented having a global state with context api, but the logic was not complex, so in the future i would like to try biggest projects to handle more complex logic
